## What We're Building

The Metanet Foundation develops open source tools for a peer-to-peer web built on the Metanet API (BRC-100) — the unified standard for how wallets and applications communicate.

---

## Repositories

### SDKs

Production-ready libraries for Metanet integration with full API coverage: transaction construction, certificate management, identity verification, encryption, and overlay connectivity.

- **TypeScript SDK** — Browser and Node.js environments
- **Go SDK** — High-performance server applications

### Wallet Toolbox

Everything needed to build Metanet-compatible wallets: key derivation, transaction signing, identity certificate handling, and BRC-100 compliance utilities.

### Overlay Services

Reference implementations of core infrastructure that makes the Metanet practical:

- **Identity Overlay** — Certificate issuance, revocation, reputation, selective disclosure
- **Transaction Overlay** — UTXO management, broadcasting, merkle proofs
- **Token Overlay** — Balance indexing, transfer history, metadata services

### Token & Contract Templates

Audited, security-reviewed templates for common patterns:

- Escrow (two-party and multi-party)
- Token issuance (fungible and non-fungible)
- Marketplace contracts
- Access control and token-gating
