## 🌐 Mission

DDID Global establishes the **global standard for digital trust** by certifying businesses, applications, and smart contracts through blockchain-based, verifiable credentials. We are a nonprofit foundation building decentralized trust infrastructure for global commerce.

## 📊 The Problem

The global digital economy faces a trust crisis:

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **$485B+** | Lost annually to business fraud globally |
| **72%** | Of enterprises report counterparty verification challenges |
| **89%** | Of cross-border transactions require manual due diligence |
| **3.2M+** | Fraudulent business registrations detected annually |

**Current solutions are failing:**
- Centralized verification creates single points of failure
- Legacy KYB processes take weeks, not minutes
- Siloed data prevents credential portability
- Regional solutions don't scale globally

## 🏛️ Three Pillars of Certification

### 1. Business & Individual Identity
Verify the legitimacy of entities and their representatives through comprehensive due diligence.
- Business registration verification
- Beneficial ownership mapping
- Director & officer validation
- Ongoing compliance monitoring

### 2. Applications & Software
Certify digital products meet security, privacy, and quality standards.
- Security audit verification
- Privacy compliance certification
- Code quality assessment
- Ongoing vulnerability monitoring

### 3. Smart Contracts
Validate the safety and reliability of on-chain code before deployment.
- Formal verification status
- Audit firm attestations
- Known vulnerability checks
- Upgrade pattern analysis

## 🔑 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Decentralized by Design** | No single point of failure or control. Trust is distributed across the network. |
| **Global from Day One** | Standards work across all jurisdictions. Universal interoperability is built in. |
| **Privacy-Preserving** | Zero-knowledge proofs enable verification without exposing sensitive data. |
| **Portable Reputation** | Credentials follow you across platforms and borders. Build once, verify everywhere. |

## 🏅 Certification Tiers
